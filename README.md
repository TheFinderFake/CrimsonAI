# CrimsonAI
AI script to replace Calm AI for GTA 5's FiveM

Feature include:

- Dynamic ped and vehicle density settings based on time and weather (NOTE: I recommend you change the values for the densities to what you would like them to be for the time or weather)
- Set and limit player wanted level to 0
- Remove most if not hopefully all the known AI dispatch groups

New features to come later on as they are made
